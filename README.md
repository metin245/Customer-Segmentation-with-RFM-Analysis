<p>The Project was divided into Three Parts i.e. :</p>
<p id="Exploratory Data Analysis">  <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </h4></p>
<p>Statistics were computed to find out the probabilities of converting regardless of page. These were used to analyze if one page or the other led to more conversions.</p>

 - Analyse the descriptive statistics of the data set.
 - Analyse the data set for missing data and remove missing data from the data set if necessary.
 - List the 5 most ordered products in descending order.
 - Define the RFM metrics
 - Select 3 segments that you consider important. Comment on these three segments both in terms of action decisions and the structure of the segments.
   
        
<p id="Results">  <h3> Results </h3></p>
<p>Lots of the times keeping existing customers is far more efficient than gaining new customers. So companies might focus on the groups with high frequency and low recency scores like “Can’t loose them”, “at risk”. This customers were “champions” or “loyal customers” at some point and it would be beneficial to win them back. Note that different approaches should be taken in different fields and industries.</p>
